# Butter Barbies — CampusShare Platform

> **Hackathon Project for Ramaiah University Fest — Yugastra**

## Introduction

**Butter Barbies** is the team behind **CampusShare** — a community-driven academic resource sharing platform built for **Yugastra**, the annual university fest of **Ramaiah University**. This hackathon project tackles the problem of siloed study materials on campus.

Students spend hours hunting for notes, past papers, and solved assignments that already exist somewhere. CampusShare changes that by creating a **trusted, searchable, campus-specific repository** where contributors are recognized and rewarded, and seekers find what they need — fast.

## Problem Statement

Academic resources on campus are fragmented:
- **WhatsApp groups** have no search
- **Google Drive** links expire
- **Library systems** are bureaucratic
- **Existing platforms** (StudyLib, Scribd) aren't campus-specific and lack community trust

**CampusShare** bridges this gap with a platform built *by students, for students*.

## Recognition Points & Rewards System

CampusShare incentivizes contributions through a points-based recognition system. The more you share, the more you earn.

| Action                          | Points |
|--------------------------------|--------|
| Upload a resource              | +10    |
| Per download of your resource  | +2     |
| Per positive rating received   | +1     |
| Daily login streak (3+ days)   | +3     |

**How it works:**
- Points are tracked on each user's profile and displayed publicly
- A **Leaderboard** showcases the top contributors on campus
- Points accumulate over time, rewarding consistent contributors
- The system creates a positive feedback loop — contributors upload more because they see recognition
